# BallisticPay: A Comprehensive Architecture for Decentralized Payroll, UBI, and Capital Growth

**Abstract**  
This paper presents BallisticPay, a blockchain-native infrastructure designed to revolutionize salary distribution, employee identity, and passive income generation. The system integrates Universal Basic Income (UBI) principles, capital investment, and programmable token-based salary disbursement into a decentralized architecture. We outline the key challenges in contemporary payroll systems and detail our proposed architecture's modules, including token preference mechanisms, decentralized identity, UBI deductions, capital deployment strategies, and year-end bonus distribution. The solution offers a flexible, secure, and growth-focused payroll system particularly suited for the crypto-native and globally distributed workforce.
